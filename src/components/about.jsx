            <p>Life pivots can be challenging and when I feel overwelmed I get still. Like real still. I listening to sounds of nature and it's as if my whole body re-enters the present moment. I am reminded in these moments to trust the path that layes ahead while celebrating all the beautiful, chaotic and challenging moments of life unfolding right now.</p>
            <p>Over the past months I found myself reflecting all the black women who have inspired me, created new paths for me and sacrafieced so much in hope of a better future for all black women. Past, Present and future -- we all play a role and I'm honored to be able to pair my coding and technology skills to build a small yet inspirational library of quotes from black women. Availble in an npm packages. Quotes are stored as a JSON file and the API is clean and easy. Use them, read them, spread them. But most importantly believe them - the wisdom of these black women is timeless.</p>
