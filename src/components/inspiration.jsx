        <p className="inspiration-text">As a side project,
        I reached out to friends, my mom, and women I've met over the years. I asked them to send me quotes from Black women who
        inspire them daily. I collected over 65 quotes and stored them in a downloadable npm package to make them accessible to
        everyone. The package has a simple API and generates a random quote from the list with the author's name. I designed this
        package to help infuse your newest project, webpage, desktop app, or another creative endeavor with timeless quotes by Black
        women for the world to see. The packed is called "black-women-inspire" and is availble for download on the npm package registry.</p>
